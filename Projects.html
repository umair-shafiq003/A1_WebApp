        <h3>Project: Online Food Ordering System; HUNGER DELIGHTS .CO </h3>
        <p>
            The Online Food Ordering and Reservation System is a Python-based solution facilitating convenient food ordering 
            and table reservations at restaurants. Users can create accounts, browse menus, place orders for delivery or pickup, 
            and make table reservations seamlessly. Restaurant owners have access to management tools for menus, orders, and reservations, 
            while administrators oversee the system's operation. With features like real-time order tracking and analytics, the system
            enhances the dining experience for customers and optimizes operations for restaurants.
